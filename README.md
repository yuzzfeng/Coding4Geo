# Coding4Geo

An open-access and interactive coding platform to facilitate E-Teaching in Geospatial Data Analysis (Coding4Geo)
<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/coding4geo/"><img src="doc/logos/Coding4geo_Logo_black.png" style="width:100px;"></a></p>

The project Coding4Geo aims at providing an online interactive coding platform allowing automatically checking of student submissions and initially serve the students from geoinformatics related courses at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The longer-term scope aims at a platform, which provides the opportunity to be extended and deployed for many other ESS-related disciplines.
